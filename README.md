# Random Generator for Pen & Paper

## Description

A tool that provides everything for a fun pen & paper adventure. You can simulate 
one or more different dice and perform a simple coinflip. If you have multiple 
names for a character and can not decide, then you can add these names to a list 
and let Random Generator decide!
